## How Generative AI are Solving the Problem

Generative AI plays a pivotal role in addressing NotchAI's primary challenge: rapid and accurate diagnosis and patient scanning. By leveraging generative AI algorithms, our solution can swiftly analyze live patient data, such as skin rashes or symptoms, in real-time through image recognition or natural language processing. This technology allows for rapid assessments, identifying potential medical conditions and suggesting treatment options with remarkable speed and precision. It revolutionizes healthcare by providing immediate, reliable insights, ultimately expediting the diagnostic process and improving patient outcomes while reducing the burden on medical professionals and facilities.
